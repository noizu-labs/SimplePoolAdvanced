defmodule Noizu.AdvancedPool.DispatcherRouter do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides routing and dispatching services for worker processes within the Noizu AdvancedPool framework.

  This module is responsible for locating and registering worker processes, dispatching messages to workers,
  and initiating workers when necessary. It offers a set of core functions used by the AdvancedPool system to
  manage worker processes in a distributed environment efficiently.

  Functionality includes:

  - Finding worker processes in the pool's registry.
  - Registering worker processes with their associated metadata.
  - Handling message dispatching, which may involve starting new workers if they are not currently running and are needed.
  - Providing internal support for dynamic dispatch within the pool's context.

  Internally, the module leverages the `:syn` library to perform operations on a registry that keeps track of active
  worker processes. It uses Elixir's `apply/3` mechanism to dynamically call functions related to pool operations,
  increasing the flexibility and scalability of the worker management system.

  While the core functionalities are designed to be system-internal, they play a critical role in enabling AdvancedPool
  to maintain a responsive and resilient pool of workers, capable of handling incoming requests and performing distributed
  tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster.

  [INTERNAL]
  Initiates the process of starting a worker within the specified pool using the provided reference and settings.

  It enriches the provided options with a `:return_task` flag set to `true`, ensuring that the `start_worker` function of the `ClusterManager` will return a task. The function then delegates to the `ClusterManager.start_worker/5` to begin the worker start-up sequence.

  This function is essential for spinning up new worker processes in the pool in response to system demands, providing dynamic scalability and responsiveness to load.

  [INTERNAL]
  Looks up a worker process in the registry using its reference.

  Utilizes the `:syn` library to query the registry for the provided worker reference. Returns a tuple with the worker's PID and additional informational metadata if found, or an error tuple if the worker is not registered.

  This function is part of the internal mechanics that allow rapid resolution of process identifiers, a fundamental aspect of efficient message dispatch within a distributed system.

  [INTERNAL]
  Processes messages intended for workers, handling registration and dispatching logic.

  First, it attempts to resolve the recipient process' PID via the registry. If unresolved and auto-spawning is enabled, it delegates to `start_worker/5` to create the worker. It encapsulates internal decision-making for how messages should be routed based on the recipient's current state or needs.

  This "__process__" function forms a critical part of the message routing lifecycle, ensuring messages reach their intended destinations or are handled appropriately if they do not.
