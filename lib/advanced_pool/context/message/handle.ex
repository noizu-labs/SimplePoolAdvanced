defmodule Noizu.AdvancedPool.Message.Handle do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles the routing and processing of messages within the Noizu AdvancedPool.

  This module provides the mechanisms required to unpack and route various types of messages within the worker pool. It contains logic to process synchronous calls (`handle_call`), asynchronous casts (`handle_cast`), and informational messages (`handle_info`) that are not directly related to synchronous or asynchronous communications.

  Calls to these functions are typically made as part of the GenServer process lifecycle and include a variety of checks to ensure that messages are directed and handled by the appropriate processes.

  ## Functions

    - `unpack_call/3`: Processes incoming GenServer calls.
    - `unpack_cast/2`: Handles incoming GenServer casts.
    - `unpack_info/2`: Deals with unsolicited informational messages.
    - `uncaught_call/3`: Fallback for unhandled calls.
    - `uncaught_cast/2`: Fallback for unhandled casts.
    - `uncaught_info/2`: Fallback for unhandled informational messages.

  The module's private functions provide internal support for message routing:

    - `recipient_check/2` and `recipient_check/3`: Validate the intended recipient of a message.
    - `worker_check/1`: Ensures that the worker's state is ready for message handling.
    - `reroute/1` and `reroute/2`: Decide the next steps when a message is sent to a recipient that is no longer valid or has been moved.
    - `drop/1` and `drop/2`: Skip message handling when necessary, with possible notification to the sender in the case of direct calls.
    - `handler/1`: Retrieves the appropriate handler from the worker state for delegating message processing.

  The primary objective of this module is to ensure efficient and correct message processing throughout the Noizu AdvancedPool, contributing to the reliability and flexibility of the worker pool system.

  @doc """
  Processes an incoming synchronous call message by verifying the recipient and worker's state before invoking the
  worker's `handle_call` function.

  `unpack_call/3` first ensures the message is intended for the current recipient by calling `recipient_check/3`.
  It then checks if the worker's state is ready to handle the message via `worker_check/1`.
  If all checks pass, the `handle_call` function of the worker's handler module is applied
  with the given message and state.
  `apply(handler, :handle_call([call.msg, from, state])`

  This function serves as the primary entry point for handling GenServer-like call messages, ensuring that only
  properly addressed and state-validated messages are processed. It encapsulates the checks and invocation logic to
  maintain clean and consistent handling of synchronous call operations.
  """
  def unpack_call(M.msg_envelope(msg: m) = call, from, %{__struct__: _} = state) do
    with :ok <- recipient_check(call, from, state),
         {:ok, state} <- worker_check(state) do
      handler(state)
      |> apply(:handle_call, [m, from, state])
    else
      {:error, :redirect} -> reroute(call, from, state)
      error = {:error, {:invalid_state,state}} -> {:reply, error,  state}
      _ -> drop(call, from, state)
    end
  end


  @doc """
  Handles an incoming asynchronous cast message by validating the recipient and worker's state before calling
  the worker's `handle_cast` function.

  `unpack_cast/2` checks the message recipient is correct using `recipient_check/2` then verifies that the worker's
  state is loaded and ready using `worker_check/1`. If both validations succeed, the worker's `handle_cast`
  function is called with the message.
  `apply(handler, :handle_cast([call.msg, state])`

  This method ensures that asynchronous messages, which do not expect a response, are delivered and processed
  only when the worker is properly identified and in a ready state. It allows the system to manage message flows
  while preventing the execution of casts against uninitialized or incorrect workers.

  @doc """
  Processes non-call and non-cast messages (info messages) by confirming the worker's identity and state readiness
  before handling the message with the worker's `handle_info` function.

  `unpack_info/2` performs recipient validation and state verification similarly to `unpack_call/3` and `unpack_cast/2`.
  It ensures the message's recipient matches the worker and that the worker is in a proper state to handle the message.
  Post-validation, the `handle_info` function is invoked for message processing.
  `apply(handler, :handle_info([call.msg, state])`

  By using this function, the pool system handles arbitrary messages consistently with other message types,
  ensuring that all message processing is subject to the same validation and state checks, providing robustness and
  reliability in the message handling workflow.

  def unpack_info(M.msg_envelope(msg: m) = call, %{__struct__: _} = state) do

  @doc """
  Processes an uncaught synchronous call message by returning a specific tuple indicating the message was not handled.

  When a call message is not captured by any tailored handling logic, `uncaught_call/3` constructs a response tuple with an atom indicating it is uncaught, the original message, and a reference to the current state. This tuple is then returned with the unchanged state.

  By providing a standardized response for uncaught call messages, this function contributes to the system's fault tolerance. It prevents unhandled messages from causing errors or disruptions by explicitly acknowledging their uncaught status, allowing for possible logging or diagnostic actions downstream.
  """
  def uncaught_call(msg, _, state) do
    {:reply, {:uncaught, msg, Noizu.ERP.ref(state)}, state}
  end

  @doc """
  Provides a fallback mechanism for uncaught asynchronous cast messages by continuing the process without replying.

  In cases where a cast message does not match any specific handling rules, `uncaught_cast/2` returns a `:noreply` tuple, thus intentionally ignoring the uncaught message and preserving the current state.

  The purpose of this function is to silently skip handling of uncaught cast messages while preserving the integrity and continuity of the worker process. Since casts naturally do not expect replies, this behavior aligns with the asynchronous nature of cast messages. It allows the process to remain responsive and continue operations without impediment from unhandled messages.
  """
  def uncaught_cast(_, state) do
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  @doc """
  Handles uncaught info messages by proceeding without replying, similar to unhandled cast messages.

  When an info message is received that doesn't match known patterns or handling criteria, `uncaught_info/2` ensures the worker process does not send a reply and maintains its current state.

  This method maintains consistent behavior with `uncaught_cast/2`, reflecting the asynchronous nature of such messages. It prevents the worker process from reacting to or being affected by unhandled info messages, allowing it to continue regular operations without interruption, contributing to the overall robustness of the message handling system.
