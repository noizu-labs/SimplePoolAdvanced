defmodule Noizu.AdvancedPool.DefaultSupervisor do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines the default supervisor for `Noizu.AdvancedPool`, responsible for initiating and managing
  a supervisor hierarchy within a pool of workers. The `DefaultSupervisor` serves as the top-level
  supervisor for the pool, capable of configuring its children supervisors and servers based on the
  applicable context and options.

  It leverages the configuration provided by developers for custom behaviors, while also providing
  default settings for different strategies pertaining to supervision and worker management.
  The supervisor is crucial for maintaining the fault tolerance of the pool by overseeing the
  behavior of supervisors that manage individual worker processes.

  When launched, it ensures that the supervisory process joins the appropriate cluster and sets up
  the related server and workers accordingly. It can operate both in standalone mode and as part of
  a clustered environment, adjusting its behavior based on the configuration.

  @doc """
  Starts the default supervisor with a unique identifier, utilizing the provided pool module and context to
  configure the supervisor's behavior. It will use either the configured supervisor module or default to
  itself when starting the supervisor process.

  The `start_link/4` pattern integrates the pool into the OTP supervision structure, linking it to the top-level
  supervisor and ensuring that it adheres to the predefined supervision strategies. The identity and name of
  the supervisor are derived based on the pool's id or directly from the pool itself.

  This function serves as the entry point for creating the pool's supervisory tree and integrating it into
  the running application's supervision hierarchy.

  Sets a default target for the maximum number of worker processes a supervisor should manage.
  This default target acts as a threshold to inform scaling and spawning decisions within the pool.

  By providing a predetermined target, `default_worker_target/0` simplifies configuration by establishing an
  inferred baseline that can be overridden with specific demands as needed. It ensures that there is an out-of-the-box
  value for immediate use, promoting a quick setup while maintaining flexibility for adaptation.

  Initializes the supervisor with the provided configuration, determining if it should operate in standalone mode

  The `init/1` function orchestrates the bootstrapping of the supervisory tree according to the pool's configuration.
  It sets the supervision strategy and delegates to subcomponents like servers and worker supervisors to create a
  cohesive structure that ensures the pool's operational integrity.
